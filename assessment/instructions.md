# World Cup on-chain betting: candidate instructions

## Your task

Implement **`contracts/contracts/WorldCupBetting.sol`**.

The file you start from is a **stub**: every function reverts with `WorldCupBetting: candidate implementation required`. Your job is to replace that with working logic so the assessment tests pass.

Follow any extra rules you were given (for example whether you may read other contracts in the repo, time limits, and what to submit).

---

## Time and stack

- **Time**: use the limit you were assigned (often a few hours for a full pass).
- **Stack**: Hardhat, TypeScript tests, Solidity `^0.8.30`, OpenZeppelin (`ReentrancyGuard`, `Ownable`).

---

## Setup

1. From the repo root, go into the contracts package and install dependencies. If npm reports a `chai` peer conflict, use:

   ```bash
   cd contracts
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

2. If Hardhat prints **HH801** and asks for missing toolbox packages, install the versions it lists, then try again.

3. Optional compile:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

---

## How to run the assessment

Run only the World Cup assessment tests:

```bash
cd contracts
npx hardhat test
```

On an unimplemented stub, **all tests should fail**. When your `WorldCupBetting.sol` is correct, **all tests should pass**.

You may read **`test/WorldCupBetting.assessment.test.ts`** to see what is expected (scenarios A through I).

---

## What your contract must support

The tests call the public API on `WorldCupBetting` and check revert strings in several places. Implement behavior that matches what those tests do.

| Area | Functions to implement |
| --- | --- |
| Lifecycle | `createMarket`, `placeBet`, `resolveMarket`, `claimWinnings` |
| Access | Only the market's arbitrator may resolve; only the owner may `withdrawFees` |
| Time | Allow bets while `block.timestamp < resolutionTime`; allow resolution only when `block.timestamp >= resolutionTime` |
| Collateral | `tokenAddress == address(0)` means native ETH (`msg.value`); otherwise use ERC20 `transferFrom` / `transfer` on that token |
| Fees | Take a **2%** platform fee on the winning payout path; track it in `getAvailableFees` and pay it out via `withdrawFees` |
| Secondary market | `listPosition`, `buyPosition` (and `cancelListing` exists on the stub for parity) |
| Reputation | From `claimWinnings`, call `ReputationSystem.updateReputation` for both winning and losing claims, as the tests assume |

Revert messages the tests assert include, among others: `Too early`, `Only arbitrator`, `Market closed`, `Slippage exceeded`, `Already claimed`. Match those strings where the tests use `revertedWith(...)`.

---

## What each scenario is about

| ID | Idea |
| --- | --- |
| **A** | Three-way match result (1X2), then resolve and read `getMarket` status |
| **B** | Two-sided ETH pool, winner paid net of fee, owner withdraws ETH fees |
| **C** | Cannot resolve before `resolutionTime` |
| **D** | Only the arbitrator can resolve |
| **E** | No new bets at or after the resolution timestamp |
| **F** | `placeBet` enforces `_minShares` (slippage) |
| **G** | List a position, someone else buys it, that buyer claims if the outcome wins |
| **H** | Same flows using an ERC20 as collateral |
| **I** | Losing side still runs through `claimWinnings`; cannot claim twice |

---

## Before you submit

- [ ] `npx hardhat test test/WorldCupBetting.assessment.test.ts` passes with your `WorldCupBetting.sol`.
- [ ] You can explain how fees work in **Scenario B** and how ownership moves in **Scenario G**.

Good luck.
