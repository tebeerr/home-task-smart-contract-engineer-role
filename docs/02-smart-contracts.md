# Smart Contracts

## Overview

Three smart contracts deployed on Sepolia testnet:

1. **PredictionMarket** - Core betting and market logic
2. **ReputationSystem** - User reputation and accuracy tracking
3. **MockERC20** - Test USDC token for stablecoin markets

## Contract Architecture

### PredictionMarket Contract

**Location**: `contracts/contracts/PredictionMarket.sol`

**Inherits**:
- `ReentrancyGuard` - Protection against reentrancy attacks
- `Ownable` - Owner-only functions for fee withdrawal

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Market creation and management
- Bet placement and share calculation
- Market resolution by arbitrators
- Winnings claims and payouts
- Position trading (listing/buying)
- Platform fee collection (2%)

#### Data Structures

```solidity
struct Market {
    uint256 id;
    string question;
    string description;
    string[] outcomes;
    uint256 resolutionTime;
    address arbitrator;
    address creator;
    uint256 createdAt;
    MarketStatus status;
    uint256 winningOutcome;
    address tokenAddress;      // 0x0 for ETH, ERC20 address for tokens
    uint256 totalVolume;
}

struct Bet {
    uint256 id;
    address bettor;
    uint256 marketId;
    uint256 outcomeIndex;
    uint256 amount;
    uint256 shares;
    uint256 timestamp;
    bool claimed;
}

enum MarketStatus { Open, Closed, Resolved, Cancelled }
```

**Note**: Status 1 (Closed) and 3 (Cancelled) are defined but not used in current implementation.

#### State Variables

```solidity
uint256 public marketCount;
uint256 public betCount;
uint256 public constant PLATFORM_FEE = 2;           // 2%
uint256 public constant FEE_DENOMINATOR = 100;

IReputationSystem public reputationSystem;

mapping(uint256 => Market) public markets;

    uint256 _marketId,
    uint256 _outcomeIndex,
    uint256 _amount
) external payable nonReentrant returns (uint256)

**claimWinnings**
```solidity
function claimWinnings(uint256 _betId) external nonReentrant
```

- Losers: Marks as claimed (no payout)
- Updates user reputation for both winners and losers
- Stores collected fees in `collectedFees` mapping
- Emits: `WinningsClaimed(betId, claimer, amount)` (only for winners)

**listPosition**
```solidity
function listPosition(uint256 _betId, uint256 _price) external
```
- Lists position for sale on marketplace
- Only position owner can list
- Market must be open
- Bet must not be claimed
- Emits: `PositionListed(betId, price)`

**buyPosition**
```solidity
function buyPosition(uint256 _betId) external payable nonReentrant
```
- Buys listed position with ETH
- Transfers ownership (updates `bet.bettor`)
- Pays seller via ETH transfer
- Removes from sale
- Emits: `PositionSold(betId, seller, buyer, price)`

**withdrawFees**
```solidity
function withdrawFees(address _tokenAddress) external onlyOwner nonReentrant
```

    uint256 _amount
) public view returns (uint256)
```

Formula:
- If pool empty: `shares = amount * 100`
- Otherwise: `shares = (amount * 100 * totalPool) / (newPool * currentPool)`

**Price Calculation**
```solidity
function getPrice(uint256 _marketId, uint256 _outcomeIndex)
    public view returns (uint256)
```

Formula: `price = (outcomePool * 100) / totalPool`

## Contract Interactions

### ETH Market Flow

```
User → PredictionMarket.createMarket(..., tokenAddress: 0x000...000)
    └─ MarketCreated event

User → PredictionMarket.placeBet(marketId, outcome, amount)
    ├─ msg.value = amount (ETH)
    ├─ Shares calculated
    ├─ Pools updated
    └─ BetPlaced event
```

### ERC20 Market Flow

```
User → PredictionMarket.createMarket(..., tokenAddress: USDC)
    └─ MarketCreated event

User → MockERC20.approve(PredictionMarket, amount)
    └─ Approval event

User → PredictionMarket.placeBet(marketId, outcome, amount)
    ├─ ERC20.transferFrom(user, contract, amount)
    ├─ Shares calculated
    ├─ Pools updated
    └─ BetPlaced event
```

### Resolution and Claiming

```
Arbitrator → PredictionMarket.resolveMarket(marketId, winningOutcome)
    ├─ Time check: block.timestamp >= resolutionTime
    ├─ Status = Resolved
    └─ MarketResolved event

Winner → PredictionMarket.claimWinnings(betId)
    ├─ Calculate payout: (shares * totalPool) / totalWinningShares
    ├─ Fee: payout * 2%
    ├─ Net payout: payout - fee
    ├─ Store fee: collectedFees[token] += fee
    ├─ ReputationSystem.updateReputation(winner, true)
    ├─ Transfer net payout
    └─ WinningsClaimed event

Loser → PredictionMarket.claimWinnings(betId)
    ├─ Mark claimed: bet.claimed = true
    ├─ ReputationSystem.updateReputation(loser, false)
    └─ No event (no payout)
```

---

## Events

### PredictionMarket Events

```solidity
event MarketCreated(uint256 indexed marketId, address indexed creator, string question);
event BetPlaced(uint256 indexed betId, uint256 indexed marketId, address indexed bettor, uint256 amount);
event MarketResolved(uint256 indexed marketId, uint256 winningOutcome);
event WinningsClaimed(uint256 indexed betId, address indexed claimer, uint256 amount);
event PositionListed(uint256 indexed betId, uint256 price);
event PositionSold(uint256 indexed betId, address seller, address buyer, uint256 price);
event FeesWithdrawn(address indexed token, uint256 amount, address indexed to);
```

### ReputationSystem Events

```solidity
event ReputationUpdated(address indexed user, uint256 newReputation, bool correct);
```

---

## Security Features

### ReentrancyGuard
Applied to: `placeBet`, `claimWinnings`, `buyPosition`, `withdrawFees`

Prevents reentrancy attacks during external calls and transfers.

### Access Control
- `resolveMarket`: Only market's designated arbitrator
- `withdrawFees`: Only contract owner
- `updateReputation`: Only PredictionMarket contract

### Input Validation
- Resolution time must be in future (market creation)
- Outcome index must be valid
- Bet amounts must be > 0
- Market must be open for betting
- Arbitrator address must be valid (not 0x0)
- Resolution only after resolution time passes

### Transfer Safety
- ETH transfers use `.transfer()` (2300 gas limit)
- ERC20 transfers use OpenZeppelin's `IERC20` interface
- All transfers checked for success implicitly
